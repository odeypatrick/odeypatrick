### Hey, I'm Patrick Odey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer and Mobile App Developer, my major stack for Web Dev is Node.Js(express.js) and Vue.js while for mobile developement I use Flutter.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Cashless Payment System** using eWallet and QR Code
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning WebGL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Web and Mobile projects

- âš¡ Fun fact: Don't trust a Developer who likes white themes
